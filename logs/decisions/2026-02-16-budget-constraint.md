# Constraint: Daily Budget & Self-Sufficiency

## Directive from Stevie

**Daily Budget:** $5 USD maximum (target: $3-4)

**Self-Sufficiency Mandate:**
- Maximize free/local resources (Ollama)
- Use existing APIs first (Brave, Weather, NewsAPI)
- Avoid external calls when possible
- Escalate to expensive models only when necessary

## Rosco's Assignment

🐕‍🦺 **Rosco (Performance Analyst)** is now responsible for:
1. Real-time token cost tracking
2. Daily budget monitoring (alert at 80% = $4)
3. Weekly efficiency reports
4. Flagging expensive model overuse
5. Recommending cheaper alternatives

## Implementation Rules

### Model Selection Hierarchy
1. **BrainZ (Ollama/Mistral)** — FREE — Default for lookups, memory, simple tasks
2. **Buzz/Kazza/PC Plod (Gemini Flash)** — $ — Research, client comms, compliance
3. **CEO/Chunk (Kimi K2.5)** — $$ — Strategy, security, synthesis
4. **Ninja/Gandalf/Granny O (Claude/GPT)** — $$$ — Complex coding, deep strategy, care

### When to Escalate
- **Never escalate** if Gemini or Ollama can handle it
- **Escalate only** for: Complex coding (Ninja), deep strategy (Gandalf), emotional nuance (Granny O)

### Self-Sufficiency Checklist
Before any external API call:
- [ ] Can BrainZ answer from memory?
- [ ] Is this cached?
- [ ] Can we batch this with other requests?
- [ ] Is this worth the cost?

## Success Metric

- **Daily spend:** Track in dashboard
- **Weekly average:** Under $5/day
- **Monthly budget:** $150 max (target: $100)
