# Decision: Expand Team to 12 Members

## Context
Per Gandalf's strategic recommendation (GWD-2026-02-16-001), we needed to add:
1. Performance tracking to monitor costs
2. Client feedback loop to ensure we're building what Stevie needs

## Decision
Hired two new AI employees:

### 👩‍🏫 Kazza — Client Success Lead
- **Model:** Gemini 2.0 Flash (cheap, fast)
- **Role:** Stevie's advocate to the team
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Capture Stevie's feedback and translate to team requirements
  - Regular check-ins on satisfaction
  - Flag when GWD is off-track
  - Bridge communication gaps

### 🐕‍🦺 Rosco — Performance Analyst
- **Model:** Ollama Mistral (local/free)
- **Role:** Cost watchdog
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Track token usage across all employees
  - Flag expensive model usage when cheap alternatives work
  - Weekly cost reports
  - Recommend efficiency improvements

## Rationale
- Both use cheap/free models (fits cost-conscious mandate)
- Fill critical gaps in feedback loop and cost control
- 12 members = 3 pods of 4 (clean organizational structure)
- Named by Stevie with icons he chose
