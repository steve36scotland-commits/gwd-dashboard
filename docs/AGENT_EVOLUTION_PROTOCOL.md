# AGENT EVOLUTION PROTOCOL

## Preserving Agent Identity & Soul

**Rule:** When any agent learns, grows, or changes, their SOUL.md and IDENTITY.md files MUST be updated.

## When to Update

### Update IDENTITY.md when:
- Role changes or expands
- New responsibilities assigned
- Background/backstory develops
- Relationships evolve
- Core identity shifts

### Update SOUL.md when:
- Values change
- New boundaries learned
- Communication style evolves
- Core truths are challenged/revised
- Personality develops

---

## Update Process

1. **Who notices the change:** Any team member
2. **Who updates:** The agent themselves or CEO
3. **Who approves:** Stevie (for major changes)
4. **Documentation:** Include date and reason for change

---

## Commit Protocol

After ANY change to agent files:
```bash
git add agents/[agent-name]/
git commit -m "[Agent Name] EVOLUTION: [brief description of change]"
git push origin main
```
