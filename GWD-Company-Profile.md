## What Stevie Wants

From `USER.md`:
- **Daily tasks and work organization**
- **Reminders (memory support)**
- **Improving all aspects of life**
- **Proactive messaging** — wants alerts when things need attention
- **Proactive efficiency** — save tokens/cost first and foremost
- **Use sub-agents** — delegate to save tokens
- **Direct communication** — no filler, just action

## Operating Constraints

### Daily Budget: $5 USD Maximum
- **Target:** $3-4 (under budget)
- **Hard limit:** $5/day
- **Rosco monitors:** Real-time cost tracking, alerts at 80% ($4)

### Self-Sufficiency Mandate
- **Maximize free/local resources:** Ollama (BrainZ, Rosco), local scripts
- **Use existing APIs first:** Brave Search, Weather, NewsAPI (already paid)
- **Avoid external calls when possible:** Cache results, batch requests
- **Escalate to expensive models only when necessary:** Coding, complex strategy

### Cost-Conscious Model Selection
| Model | Cost | Use When |
|-------|------|----------|
| Ollama/Mistral | FREE | Default for most tasks |
| Gemini Flash | $ | Research, quick answers |
| Kimi K2.5 | $$ | Strategy, synthesis |
| Claude/GPT-5.1 | $$$ | Complex coding only |

**Rule:** If BrainZ or Gemini can do it, don't use Claude.
