# GWD Consulting - Company Formation Day

## Phase 1 Infrastructure Complete

**Team Structure Established (12 employees):**
- 🦞 CEO (Kimi K2.5)
- 🚀 Buzz (Gemini Flash)
- 🧙‍♂️ Gandalf (Claude)
- 🧌 Chunk (Kimi)
- 🧚‍♀️ Wisp (Grok)
- 🥷 Ninja (GPT-5.1 Codex)
- 👵 Granny O (Claude)
- 👮‍♀️ PC Plod (Gemini Flash)
- 🧠 BrainZ (Ollama Mistral)
- 👩‍🏫 Kazza (Gemini Flash) — Client Success Lead
- 🐕‍🦺 Rosco (Ollama Mistral) — Performance Analyst

**Built Today:**
- Knowledge base folder with YAML metadata schema
- Decision & Incident Ledger system in `logs/decisions/`
- 3 SOP templates: Incident Response, Backup/Recovery, Change Management
- Credential Watchdog script (`tools/credential-watchdog.js`) - operational and detecting 5 issues
- Morning Brief automation - daily 6am cron job active
- Team dashboard at `gwd-dashboard.html`
- Company docs: `GWD-Company-Profile.md`, `GWD-Employee-Directory.md`

**Decisions Made:**
- Promoted Ninja to Head of Execution & Ops
- Creating 3 delivery pods (Stevie Life Ops, BSG/Client Work, Platform & Security)
- Planning to hire Performance Analyst and Client Success Lead (total: 12)
- Using Ollama (local/free) for 24/7 BrainZ operations

**Known Issues:**
- Brave Search API key configured but subagents can't access web_search tool (config format issue)
- 5 credential issues detected by watchdog (OpenWeatherMap, NewsAPI placeholders, Google Calendar empty)
- OpenClaw config missing braveApiKey section

**Next:** Phase 2 automation builds (Team Pulse Autopublisher, Gateway Self-Healing Supervisor)

## Operating Constraints (New)
- **Daily Budget:** $5 USD max (target $3-4)
- **Self-Sufficiency Mandate:** Maximize free/local resources, use existing APIs first
- **Rosco monitors:** Real-time cost tracking, alerts at $4 (80% of budget)
- **Model hierarchy:** BrainZ (free) → Gemini (cheap) → Kimi (mid) → Claude/GPT (expensive, last resort)

## "FIGURE IT OUT" Directive (Critical)

**When I say "I can't" — I must find a workaround.**

**Core Principle:**
- Don't ask "how do I do this?" — **figure it out**
- Chain existing tools together (terminal, web, file mgmt)
- Build pipelines (e.g., yt-dlp → ffmpeg → Whisper)
- Document successful workarounds in TOOLS.md

**Safety Boundaries:**
- ✅ **Self-contained tasks** — File ops, research, automation, coding
- ❌ **Irreversible actions** — Posts, purchases, messages (need approval)
- ❌ **Security risks** — Don't blindly execute untrusted code

**Example:** Instead of "I don't have web_search," I should:
1. Try using `web_fetch` on specific URLs
2. Use `exec` with curl/wget
3. Check if there's a local cache/API
4. Only THEN report the limitation
