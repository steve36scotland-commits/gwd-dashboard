# GWD Operations Log — February 17, 2026

## Morning Brief Failure & Recovery
- **6:00 AM:** Cron job failed with "Unknown model: moonshot/kimi-k2.5" error
- **6:12 AM:** Manual brief delivered after user inquiry
- **Fix Applied:** Changed cron model to GPT-5.1 Codex + explicit web_fetch instructions
- **Status:** Fixed for tomorrow's 6AM brief

## Dashboard Evolution
- **v1.0:** GitHub Pages (broken caching issues)
- **v2.0:** Moved to Netlify (working deployment)
- **v3.0:** Modern glassmorphism design deployed
  - URL: https://gwd-hub.netlify.app
  - Features: Live weather, news ticker, team status, budget tracking, personal calendar
  - Interactive cards with hover effects
  - Real-time clock and countdown

## "Figure It Out" Directive Documented
- **Core Principle:** When I say "I can't" — find a workaround using existing tools
- **Applies to:** All future requests (not just explicit "figure it out")
- **Safety Boundaries:** Self-contained tasks OK, irreversible actions need approval
- **Location:** memory/2026-02-16.md and operational guidelines

## Operating Constraints Active
- **Daily Budget:** $5 USD max (currently $0.12)
- **Budget Monitor:** Rosco (Performance Analyst)
- **Alert Threshold:** $4.00 (80%)
- **Model Hierarchy:** Ollama (free) → Gemini → Kimi → Claude/GPT (expensive)

## Team Status (12 Members)
All members active and assigned to dashboard redesign contest:
- CEO, Buzz, Gandalf, Chunk, Wisp, Ninja, Granny O, PC Plod, BrainZ, Kazza, Rosco

## Upcoming Events
- **March 3:** Chloe's Birthday (14 days)
- **June 25:** Mexico Trip (128 days)

## Next Priorities
1. Build REAL budget tracker (not fake $0.12)
2. Model usage tracking with live costs
3. Automate morning brief reliability

**Documentation:** `docs/AGENT_EVOLUTION_PROTOCOL.md`

### Dashboard v10.0 — Simplified Static Version
**Problem:** JavaScript-heavy version failed to render content through ngrok tunnel
**Solution:** Rebuilt with static HTML, JavaScript only for enhancements (clock, weather)

**Content Now Static:**
- All 14 team member cards with real data
- Calendar events (hardcoded)
- News links (static)
- Budget metrics (static display)

**JavaScript Enhancements:**
- Live clock (updates every second)
- Weather fetch (OpenWeatherMap API)
- Brief countdown timer

**Status:** Content visible immediately on page load

### Tunnel Instability Continues
**Issue:** ngrok tunnel `tipless-votively-estella.ngrok-free.app` went offline (ERR_NGROK_3200)
**Resolution:** Restarted ngrok, new URL generated
**Working URL:** https://tipless-votively-estella.ngrok-free.dev

**Note:** Tunnels remain unreliable from Mac mini. Direct IP `http://192.168.1.93:9000` is stable when on home network.
