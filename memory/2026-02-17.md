# GWD Operations Log — February 17, 2026

## Morning Brief Failure & Recovery
- **6:00 AM:** Cron job failed with "Unknown model: moonshot/kimi-k2.5" error
- **6:12 AM:** Manual brief delivered after user inquiry
- **Fix Applied:** Changed cron model to GPT-5.1 Codex + explicit web_fetch instructions
- **Status:** Fixed for tomorrow's 6AM brief

## Dashboard Evolution
- **v1.0:** GitHub Pages (broken caching issues)
- **v2.0:** Moved to Netlify (working deployment)
- **v3.0:** Modern glassmorphism design deployed
  - URL: https://gwd-hub.netlify.app
  - Features: Live weather, news ticker, team status, budget tracking, personal calendar
  - Interactive cards with hover effects
  - Real-time clock and countdown

## "Figure It Out" Directive Documented
- **Core Principle:** When I say "I can't" — find a workaround using existing tools
- **Applies to:** All future requests (not just explicit "figure it out")
- **Safety Boundaries:** Self-contained tasks OK, irreversible actions need approval
- **Location:** memory/2026-02-16.md and operational guidelines

## Operating Constraints Active
- **Daily Budget:** $5 USD max (currently $0.12)
- **Budget Monitor:** Rosco (Performance Analyst)
- **Alert Threshold:** $4.00 (80%)
- **Model Hierarchy:** Ollama (free) → Gemini → Kimi → Claude/GPT (expensive)

## Team Status (12 Members)
All members active and assigned to dashboard redesign contest:
- CEO, Buzz, Gandalf, Chunk, Wisp, Ninja, Granny O, PC Plod, BrainZ, Kazza, Rosco

## Upcoming Events
- **March 3:** Chloe's Birthday (14 days)
- **June 25:** Mexico Trip (128 days)

## Next Priorities
1. Build REAL budget tracker (not fake $0.12)
2. Model usage tracking with live costs
3. Automate morning brief reliability
