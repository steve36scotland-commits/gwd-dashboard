- Investigated the issue with the Llama models (ollama) not being recognized.
- Confirmed that the models (llama2, mistral, neural-chat) are installed but encountered a "not allowed" error when accessing them.
- Suggested troubleshooting steps:
  1. Adjust configuration to include models in OpenClaw.
  2. Verify permissions for model directories.
  3. Ensure the OLLAMA_MODELS path is correctly set.
  4. Restart OpenClaw after configuration updates.
- Found that with configuration, the models will be recognized, allowing the user to utilize them.
